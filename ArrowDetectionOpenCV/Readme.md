Hello. I am trying recognise arrow on the image. I made the skeletonization and then i used erosion to detect statistic functions. I used kernel:
([ 0, 0, 0], [1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0]) to erode skeletonized image. Thanks to that i have knowledge that it is horizontal arrow - left or right. I did the same for vertical lines.
Now I got stuck since few days and I cannot make any progress how to detect which exactly arrow it is. I was trying hit-or-miss method but it isnâ€™t working for all cases.
I would be glad to hear some of your proposals.

I attached few screenshots from my program.
