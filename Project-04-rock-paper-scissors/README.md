# What are the rules?

The rules are very simple and probably you remember them from your childhood:


-    If you choose Rock, you will win against Scissors but lose against Paper.
-    If you choose Scissors, you will win against Paper but lose against Rock.
-    If you choose Paper, you will win against Rock but lose against Scissors.

There can be 3 to 5 rounds. The game ends when somebody gets 3 wins. If you want to play again, just click “Play again” button after a game is finished.##
