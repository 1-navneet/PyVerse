# CardGame
This generates random cards for two players. One with greater card wins the round.

The first class in our card game with Python is a Card class, which has two class variables, suits and values. Suits is a tuple of strings representing all the suits a card can be: spades, hearts, diamonds, clubs. value is a tuple of strings representing the different numeric values a card can be: 2–10, Jack, Queen, King, and Ace.


The elements of the first two indexes of the value tuple are None, so the strings in the tuple match the index they represent. So the string “2” in the tuple of values is at index 2
