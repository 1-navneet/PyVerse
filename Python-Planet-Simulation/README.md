# Python-Planet-Simulation

A simulation of planets and their orbits around the sun in Python.


Computational astrophysics is a really fun subject where we use computers to simulate astronomical objects and phenomena. To demonstrate the power and beauty of computer simulations in the study of astronomy, I show here a program I wrote with 70 lines of Python code that simulates a (somewhat) realistic solar system.


We know that planets follow orbits determined mainly by the gravity from the Sun. To calculate the orbits of a planet, we need to calculate the gravitational force from the Sun and integrate it to get the velocity and position. We learned in general physics that the force following Newton’s law of gravity combined with Newton’s second law of motion gives the acceleration:
